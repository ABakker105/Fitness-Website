# Tips for running the website:
## 1) Put MongoDB credentials into the .env files in each folder.
## 2) Make each microservice and frontend folder have their own integrated terminals.
###   - For the frontend folder, run "npm run dev"
###   - For groupmate's microservice A, run "node Server.js"
###   - For my other microservices, run "npm start"
## You are all set now!
